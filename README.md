Eclipse Extension Generator
===========================

Annotate your Eclipse extensions and automatically generate plugin.xml files.

Supported Extensions:
* @Application - Extension of org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications
* @Perspective - Extension of org.eclipse.ui.perspective
* @View - Extension of org.eclipse.ui.views

The Eclipse Extension Generator API is designed to be easily integrated into build tools like [SBuild](http://sbuild.tototec.de).

Example: Scan all class files in "target/classes" and generate the content of the plugin.xml.

```
import de.tototec.eclipse.extensiongenerator._
val pluginXml = new PluginXmlBuilder(scanDirs = Seq(Path("target/classes"))).build
```

Dependencies:
* Scala 2.10
* Javassist 3.16

Eclipse Extension Generator processes class files, and can therefore work on classes generated by various JVM languages, including Java and Scala and possible others. Let us know, If you can confirm support of your favorite JVM language.

The annotations in de.tototec.eclipse.extensiongenerator.annotation package have the class retention policy, which means they are retained in the class files but are not needed at runtime. So, at runtime you will not have to add them to the classpath. Unfortunatelly, older and current (2.10.0) Scala compilers have a bug and those annotations end up effectively with runtime retention. Here is the ticket: [SI-4788](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-4788) Vote for it or even better, fix it, if that is not acceptable for you.
